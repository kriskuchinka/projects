To Do: Potluck Party

--> Add php file specifically to make sending email of "additional comments" to my email address

--> Create JS validation for the form on each modal window

--> Once desktop version is finished, make media queries for tablet size and phone size

--> Use RegEx to make phone number in (xxx)xxx-xxxx format

--> Use RegEx to make email in xxxx@xxx.com format

--> Make JS checkboxes display checked or not checked in Data Form field

--> ????? Set up SQL DB once PHP is implemented ?????

--> Have JS entered data display appropriate words in data form in the event that a drop down menu or checkbox is not filled in correctly

--> Try to get a slim border around the checkboxes, maybe make them a bit bigger.

--> Make Additional Comments box responsive (it over-extended on the tv screen, when reduced to half size and 5/6 height of the screen)
